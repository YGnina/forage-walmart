The Ultimate Walmart Software Engineering Summer Internship Interview Guide

Disclaimer: At Forage, our mission is to get motivated students into great jobs. This exclusive content has been produced by Forage to help you on your career search.


Software engineering summer internship applications often follow this process:

    Online application
    Online technical assessment (via HackerRank or another provider)
    One-way behavioral interview (via HireVue, Cut-E or another provider)
    Final interview

This process provides candidates with plenty of opportunities to showcase their technical skills, behavioral suitability and passion for the company and role.

Online application:

Tips for your online application have been covered in your exclusive content unlocked after completing task 1. As a reminder:

    Our understanding (based on opening dates in previous years) is that applications for Walmart’s software engineering internships and full-time roles open on or near 1 September. Be sure to apply as close to this date as possible because applications are reviewed on a rolling basis (that means, the earlier you apply, the better your chances of landing a role).
    The bulk of Walmart’s software engineering hires are made for their office in Bentonville, AR.
    Ensure you meet the eligibility requirements for the role prior to applying (expected graduation date between December 2024 and December 2025, minimum 2.5 GPA, computer science or related major, authorization to work in the United States without sponsorship). If you don’t meet the eligibility requirements, you may find that your application is auto-rejected by Walmart’s applicant tracking system.


Technical assessment:

    After you complete and submit your application, it will go through an automated review to check that you are eligible for the role. If you are eligible, you may receive an invitation to complete a technical assessment.
    You will generally have a deadline to undertake your technical assessment and once you start, you will usually have to complete the assessment in one sitting.
    Your application will not be reviewed by a recruiter until you have completed your technical assessment, so it is helpful if you complete it shortly after receiving it.
    The most common technical assessment is called HackerRank. To prepare for HackerRank, you should complete problems on LeetCode. You can search on LeetCode for example problems used by various different companies (for example Walmart).
    It is common to feel unprepared for a technical assessment even after you have completed multiple practice problems on LeetCode. This is normal, try not to worry about it. Successful candidates advised they aimed to solve a minimum of 1-2 problems per day, and up to 5 problems per day during the 2-4 weeks leading up to applications opening. 
    Your aim should be to become:
        Competent at completing ‘Easy’ level problems on LeetCode with any edge cases solved
        Competent at attempting ‘Medium’ level problems on LeetCode. It is not a major issue if some edge cases remain unsolved
        Familiar at completing LeetCode problems under time pressure.
    Across various different companies, the technical assessment will differ in terms of difficulty level and duration.


One-way Behavioral Interview:

    Along with a HackerRank technical assessment, some companies will ask you to answer some behavioral interview questions via a one-way interview.
    Again, you will generally have a deadline to undertake your one-way interview and once you start, you will usually have to complete the interview in one sitting.
    Your application will not be reviewed by a recruiter until you have completed your one-way interview, so it is helpful if you complete it shortly after receiving it.
    A one-way interview is conducted via a video interviewing platform where you’re asked questions without an interviewer present. The questions come up on the screen and then you have an opportunity to record your answer. A recruiter listens to your answers separately.
    The most common provider used by employers for one-way interviews is called HireVue. While employers can configure the questions asked, they recognize it’s a fairly unusual process and typically ask common behavioral interview questions. You can see a list of common behavioral interview questions here.
    When answering behavioral interview questions in a one-way interview, you should use the STAR method to help you to structure your response and to make you feel less awkward when speaking to a blank screen. If you’re not familiar with the STAR method, read about it here.
    Don’t worry if you do feel uncomfortable when answering behavioral questions in a one-way interview, this is totally normal and everyone feels this way. The best preparation for one-way interviews is to practice responding to behavioral questions in the mirror.

Final Interview:

    After you submit your technical assessment and your one-way interview, your application is sent to a recruiter for review. Unfortunately there is no specific timeline for your application to be reviewed because it differs based on the company you applied for, the role, the location and the timing of when you applied. So don’t stress if you hear back quickly about some applications and slowly for others. 
    This interview stage involves a mixture of behavioral questions and technical questions that give you an opportunity to demonstrate coding skills in real time (data structures and algorithms are common topics for the technical component and you may be asked questions about your personal projects).
        When asked to code, don’t jump straight into coding. First, explain your approach to the interviewer and then commence coding.
    Companies are looking for candidates that demonstrate knowledge of what they do in the tech space and are seeking candidates that show an interest in this. Talking about your participation in their virtual experience program (and specific parts that you enjoyed) is an amazing way to stand out.
    Across almost all companies, interviewers for both technical and behavioral sections tend to be very kind and make the environment as welcoming and inviting as possible. No need to stress, just try your best and to enjoy yourself.

Offer:

    After completing the interview stage, you will be notified whether you have received an offer or not. Again, there is unfortunately no standard timeline, some may find out within a few days, whereas other candidates may find out weeks later.
